PREFACE
</p>

<p>
Although Paris, during the eighteenth
century, became the home of artists of
more subtle genius than Greuze, yet the pictures
of no other painter of that alluring period have
become so familiar to the people of our own
country.  Engravings, etchings, photographs,
and reproductions in colour of the works of
Greuze abound on every hand; but many have
admired the art who have not known so much
as the name of the artist, and more have known
his name, and have still been far from any
knowledge of the story of his life.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, though brief narrations of what
Greuze did and suffered in this world have
appeared in volumes that have contained also
the biographies of other artists, no book, in
this country, has been devoted solely to an
account of his romantic career.  Moreover, the
addition of twenty-one of the works of Greuze
to the possessions of the British nation by the
bequest of the Wallace Collection, and the
exhibition of nine more at the Art Gallery of
the Corporation of London in 1902, must have
awakened curiosity concerning a painter whose
peculiar place in the evolution of art in France,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pvi"></a>vi}</span>
whose character, and whose eventful life, make
his history interesting alike to those who
delight in pictures and to those who read
biography for its own sake.
</p>

<p>
The author hopes that this volume will make
more available than it has hitherto been an
account of the principal happenings in the
story of an artist with whose charming pictures
the world has been for many years so intimately
acquainted.

LIFE OF GREUZE
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<h3>
EARLY YEARS
</h3>

<p>
The way of life in which Jean Baptiste
Greuze spent his childhood and his youth
was not different from that of most other artists.
His parents were obscure people, who had no
riches; and his father opposed his desire to be
a painter.
</p>

<p>
For many years, even his own countrymen
who wrote of Greuze, gave the date of his birth
any time between 1725 and 1732; but it is
known now that the accurate date is August
21, 1725, the one which has since been
inscribed on the modest house in Tournus, near
Mâcon, where his father and mother were living
when the artist was born.
</p>

<p>
By the time that Greuze was eight years of
age he had manifested a strong inclination
towards the use of the pencil.  Drawing became
his chief amusement; and he employed,
indifferently, stray pieces of paper, or whitewashed
walls, for the display of his draughtsmanship.
His father, as the way of fathers is, had
planned for his son a position more exalted
than his own in an occupation with which he
himself was connected.  The elder Greuze was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P2"></a>2}</span>
a kind of provincial builder, contractor, and
slater; and he wished the younger Greuze to
become an architect.
</p>

<p>
Although it is not apparent why an architect,
who to-day undergoes severe discipline in
drawing, should be the worse because he had a
propensity for sketching, it has yet been stated
by some of the biographers of Greuze that the
father used persuasions and threats to prevent
the son from making drawings, and that the
boy was thereby driven to the device of
exercising his skill surreptitiously in his bedroom.
</p>

<p>
But a day came when the father saw the
folly of his continued resistance.  Mistaking
for an engraving a head of St.  James which his
son had copied with a pen, that he might give
it to his father as a birthday present, the elder
Greuze was so much impressed by the skill of
the lad that he thought it better after all to
allow him to have his own way in the choice of
a profession; and Greuze therefore became the
pupil of Grandon, of Lyons, a portrait painter.
</p>

<p>
In Grandon's constitution the artist was
subservient to the man of affairs; and De Goncourt
has written that his studio was a veritable
picture factory.  Greuze, however, had more
elevated notions of the vocation of an artist
than to remain content in marking time for the
rest of his life as a sort of inglorious
piece-worker, and his ambition and self-confidence
urged him to Paris, where he believed his
powers would win for him both fame and fortune.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P3"></a>3}</span>
</p>

<p>
In Paris Greuze worked unobtrusively, often
in solitude, and earned a precarious livelihood,
possibly not without invoking the aid of some
of the methods of the master whom he had left
in Lyons.  He was not immediately successful,
and his chance of triumphing over the obstacles
which beset a raw youth from the provinces,
seeking fame in Paris, seemed to be but a
remote one.  Yet Pigalle, the king's sculptor,
believing that Greuze had the qualities which
win success ultimately, encouraged the painter
to persevere.
</p>

<p>
Greuze had, or fancied he had, to contend
against the hostility and the jealousy of the
other artists.  At the Academy, where he went
to draw, he received less consideration than his
ability merited, and he complained eventually
to the artist Silvestre, to whom also he showed
some specimens of his work.  Silvestre,
admiring his skill, wished to have his portrait
painted by Greuze, and as Silvestre was a man
of some influence, this commission was the
means of making Greuze's name more widely
known.  About this time, too, Greuze
attracted attention by one of his representations
of scenes from the life of humbler folk
than were usually seen in pictures during that
period.  This painting was <i>L'Aveugle Trompé</i>,
and Greuze was made <i>agréé</i> of the Academy
on June 28, 1755, either by the good offices
of Silvestre or of Pigalle, and thus acquired
the right to exhibit his pictures at the annual
exhibitions.

<h3>
FAME IN PARIS
</h3>

<p>
Popular as was this picture of <i>L'Aveugle
Trompé</i>, its success was eclipsed by the fame
of <i>Un Père de Famille qui lit la Bible à ses Enfants</i>,
a work which advanced Greuze to the front
rank of the leading painters of that time.  Even
when one remembers that this is a better picture
than many which he painted afterwards, it
is yet not easy to-day to understand the
enthusiasm that it caused when it was first
exhibited.  One reason for our difficulty is that
we do not feel the force of its novelty as the
people of Paris felt it when they had become
satiated with the painted pastorals, allegories,
and coquetries of that voluptuous era.
</p>

<p>
The picture, pleasing as a whole, contains
indications of the tendency towards artificiality
which afterwards became so marked in
many of Greuze's melodramatic paintings.  But
for the rest the scene is nature in a mirror
compared with other canvases of the same century.
The painter has represented the interior of a
farm kitchen, and a devout and venerable
farmer reads, from a large Bible, some chapters
of the New Testament to the other members
of the household.  All these, from the
grandmother to the child of three years, are
picturesque and pleasing, and they are happily
placed in the picture.  This work was bought
by Monsieur de la Live de Jully, a rich
connoisseur, who invited artists and others
interested in painting to go to his house, to see
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P5"></a>5}</span>
the new kind of picture which Greuze had
introduced into Paris.
</p>

<p>
Even from artists and critics the picture won
a generous meed of praise; but, containing as
it does all the elements which still appeal to
"the man in the street," it was not until 1755,
when it was exhibited at the Salon, that it
achieved its greatest triumph.  As long as the
exhibition was open the people crowded round
this pious presentment of humble life which
had strayed so unaccountably amongst the
pictures of the Court painters&mdash;pictures which
for many years, as we shall see, had been free
from the suspicion of any odour of sanctity.
</p>

<p>
"Whence comes he?  Whose pupil is he?"
asked the bewildered Academicians, who, in the
manner of Academicians, could not believe it
possible for an artist outside their circle to
attain either excellence or fame.  The answer
came, "He is a pupil of Diderot."
</p>

<p>
Although this answer did not contain the
whole truth, it was yet significant of a change
that was taking place in the aspirations of
many French people.  Diderot, a clever and
copious man of letters, had commenced to write
about pictures, and he was now advocating
that art should be devoted to the cause of
morality.  Greuze's picture happening to
coincide with his own idea, he at once wrote an
enthusiastic, one may almost say a gushing,
eulogy of this and other similar works of the
artist; and in that way he helped to swell the
renown which Greuze had now achieved.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P6"></a>6}</span>
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, the artist, with that perversity
which one has noted in the early life of other
famous men, must now leave his own path to
go to study art in Italy.  Hundreds of years
have been needed to convince painters that the
Italian artists wrought great pictures because
they expressed their own ideas of beauty, just
as away from Italy Rembrandt "saw picturesque
grandeur and noble dignity in the
Jews' quarter of Amsterdam, and lamented not
that its inhabitants were not Greeks."  "I do
not study the ancients," wrote Chantrey, heedless
of syntax, "but I study where the ancients
studied&mdash;nature."
</p>

<p>
The ambition of Greuze at this time was to
belong to that singularly dreary and barren
class of painters known as historical painters;
and he wasted some years in the pursuit of a
project which, in the end, brought him one of
the most crushing humiliations of his whole
life.  "Woe to the artist," Goethe has written,
"who leaves his hut to squander himself in
academic halls of state!" and this woe fell upon
Greuze in exceeding bitterness when his first
historical picture was exhibited.  But that
incident belongs to the year 1769, and it was at
the end of the year 1755, when he was thirty
years of age, that he went to Italy.
</p>

<p>
Almost the only effect of his stay of two
years in Italy was that for some time the
figures in his pictures were arrayed in the
"resplendent small clothes" of the people of that
country, and had also Italian names.  The
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P7"></a>7}</span>
painter who did really influence Greuze was
Rubens, who was not an Italian, and whose
pictures, no further away than the Luxembourg
in Paris, it was in later years one of the
great delights of his life to study.
</p>

<p>
In the list of Greuze's works for the year
1757 we notice amongst some pictures of the
<i>genre</i> type&mdash;the representation, that is, of the life
of the humble&mdash;a number of paintings which
have Italian names; and then there are portraits,
and the first of that long series of heads
of girls and boys whose fame has outlasted the
fame of all his more pretentious works.
</p>

<p>
Greuze's industry was now very great, and
in 1761 there was exhibited one more of his
greater triumphs, <i>Un Mariage à l'instant où le
Père de l'accordée delivre la dot à son gendre</i>, a
picture which created another sensation in
Paris.  It was unfinished when the Salon of
that year was opened, and was hung only during
the last few days of the exhibition.  But all
through these days people gathered round it
with the same avidity with which they had
elbowed one another for a peep at <i>Un Père de
Famille qui lit la Bible à ses Enfants</i>.
</p>

<p>
During the next two years Greuze painted
portraits and heads of children, and the year
1769 is notable because of his unhappy attempt
to become a member of the Academy as an
historical painter.  He had, as we have seen,
been made <i>agréé</i>, but he had not yet complied
with the rule that required each member to
provide the Academy with one of his pictures.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P8"></a>8}</span>
The picture he now submitted bore the sufficiently
comprehensive title of <i>Septime-Sévère
reprochant à son fils Caracalla d'avoir attenté à sa
vie dans les défilés d'Ecosse et lui disant:&mdash;Si tu
désires ma mort, ordonne à Papinien de me la donner</i>.
The members of the Academy assembled, and
the picture was placed upon an easel that they
might examine it, while Greuze awaited their
verdict in another room.  In an hour the artist
was admitted.
</p>

<p>
"Monsieur Greuze," said the director, "the
Academy receives you; come forward and take
the oath."  When this ceremony had been
completed the director continued, "You have
been received; but it is as a painter of <i>genre</i>.
The Academy has considered your former
productions, which are excellent, but it has closed
its eyes upon this picture, which is worthy
neither of the Academy nor of you."
</p>

<p>
Greuze was astounded and disappointed; and
he commenced to stammer out a confused
defence of the picture, the worst probably
that he ever painted.  Then Lagrenée, taking
a pencil from one of his pockets, pointed out
some of the mistakes in drawing on the
canvas.  Greuze, cut to the heart, went away,
and continued a defence of his picture in the
newspapers.
</p>

<p>
One of the letters which Greuze sent to the
public journals is an interesting revelation of
how little of what is understood now as art
went to the making of an historical painting.
Greuze wrote:
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P9"></a>9}</span>
</p>

<p>
"In the continuation of your comments upon
the pictures exhibited at the Salon in the last
number of your journal you have been unjust
towards me upon two points; and as an
honourable man you would no doubt wish to
remove these injustices in your next issue.  In
the first place, instead of treating me as you
have treated the other artists, my confrères, to
whom you have offered, in a few lines, the
tribute of commendation which they have
merited, you have gone out of your way to
discuss, with the public, how, according to
your opinion, Poussin would have painted the
same subject.  I do not doubt, sir, that
Poussin, of the same subject, would have made a
sublime work; but to a certainty he would have
painted a very different picture from the one
which you have imagined.  I must ask you to
believe that I have studied, as carefully as you
have been able to study, the works of that great
man, and I have, above all, sought to acquire
the art of endowing my characters with
dramatic expression.  You have carried your
views a long way, it is true, inasmuch as you
have remarked that Poussin would have put
the clasps of the cloaks upon the right side,
while I have put that of the robe of Caracalla
upon the left&mdash;surely a very grave error!  But
I do not surrender so easily concerning the
character which you pretend that Poussin would
have given to the Emperor.  All the world
knows that Severus was the most passionate,
the most violent of men, and you would wish
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P10"></a>10}</span>
that when he says to his son, 'If thou desirest
my death, order Papinian to kill me with that
sword,' he should, in my picture, have an air as
calm and as tranquil as Solomon had in similar
circumstances.  I ask all sensible men to judge
whether that was or was not the expression
which should have been put on the face of that
redoubtable Emperor.
</p>

<p>
"Another injustice, much greater still, is
that, after you had endeavoured to discover how
Poussin would have treated this subject, you
have assumed that I had the idea to paint Geta,
the brother of Caracalla, in the personage
that I have placed behind Papinian.  First of
all, Geta was not present at that scene; it
was Castor the chamberlain, one of the most
faithful servants of Severus.  In the second
place, in supposing gratuitously, as you have
done, that I had the design to represent
Geta, you would have been right to have
reproached me if I had painted him too old,
because he was the younger brother of Caracalla.
Thirdly, I should still have been wrong
if I had not painted him in his armour.  You
see, sir, what absurdities you have attributed
to me in order that you might indulge your
love of criticism.  I believe you to be a man
too honest to refuse me the satisfaction of
making this letter public in your journal.  It
is due to me to be allowed to explain my own
picture and to correct the interpretation which
you have given to it without consulting me and
without consulting history.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P11"></a>11}</span>
</p>

<p>
"Do you wish to discourage an artist who
sacrifices all to merit the favours with which
the public has so far honoured him?  Why,
upon my first essay, attack me so openly?
This is to me a new kind of painting, but it is
one in which I flatter myself that I shall become
perfect as time goes on.  Why compare me
alone, amongst all my confrères, to the most
learned painter of the French school?  If you
have done this to indulge me, you have not
done it happily, for I can find nothing in all
that article but a marked design to annoy me.
Nor shall I be able to recognise any other than
that design&mdash;a most unworthy one in a writer
who ought to be impartial&mdash;until I have seen
your willingness to print my letter in your
journal."
</p>

<p>
It will be noticed that in this letter there is
not a single word written about art.  All the
discussion turns upon archæological details.
Poussin is not mentioned as an artist, but
merely as a "learned painter," and we shall
see, when we discuss the position held by
Greuze amongst French artists, that scholars,
excellent in their own place, came at length to
push the painters "from their stools," with very
disastrous results for the art of France.
</p>

<p>
Even Diderot turned upon this picture and
condemned it; for he and his followers now
saw that after all Greuze was not the painter
of morality for whom they had been seeking.
Greuze, it appeared, was ready "to pay homage
to traditional conventions," and to become a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P12"></a>12}</span>
backslider from the ideals which they had
cherished.  After this scene Greuze refused to
exhibit any of his pictures at the annual
exhibitions of the Academy until the Revolution
swept away restrictions, and opened the doors
of the Salon to all artists.  He also shook the
dust of Paris from his feet, and lived for a time
in Anjou, where he painted a number of
pictures, including that portrait of Madame de
Porcin which is to-day one of the treasures of
the museum of Angers.
</p>

<p>
When Greuze returned to Paris his repute
was greater than it had ever been before.  It
was now the fashion to visit his studio, and royal
princes, the nobility, the Emperor Joseph the
Second and other foreign notabilities came to
see <i>La Cruche Cassée</i>, <i>La Malédiction Paternelle</i>,
<i>La Dame de Charité</i>, <i>Le Fils Puni</i>, and other
paintings which happened at that time to be
still in his possession.  He amassed money
notwithstanding the great losses caused by his
wife's lawless extravagance.  High prices
were paid for his paintings, and the engravers
Massard, Gaillard, Levasseur and Flipart were
kept busy making plates, the impressions from
which were in the houses of Paris, of the
provinces, and of foreign countries.  Moreover,
curious dilettanti, people of the kind whose
chief regard is for technical and accidental
states of the plates, began to collect these
engravings, and to compete with one another to
possess them.  One engraver, Jean Georges
Wille, had always been the staunch friend of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P13"></a>13}</span>
Greuze; and his son, Pierre Alexandre, became
a pupil in Greuze's studio.  At a time when
the artist had been less known, it was Wille
who disseminated a knowledge of his works,
not only in France, but also in Germany.
</p>

<p><a id="chap03"></a></p>

<h3>
POVERTY AND DEATH
</h3>

<p>
Suddenly, amidst all the splendour of his
great reputation, the Revolution smote Paris,
and Greuze was bereaved of all his glory.
The pension he had received from the King
ceased with the authority of the King.  The
attention of the people was withdrawn from him,
and such regard as was paid to pictures during
this distracted epoch went to the paintings of
David, who was both painter and politician.
Greuze's ironical inquiry each morning, "Who
is King to-day, then?" is significant of the
instability of the time.  No more the elite of
Paris crowded round his easel; but one of his
two daughters still remained with him; and a
number of his scholars, especially his girl pupils,
were faithful to the end.
</p>

<p>
"You have a family and you have talent,
young man," he once said to Prudhon; "that
is enough in these days to bring about one's
death by starvation.  Look at my cuffs,"
continued the old man bitterly; and then Greuze
would show him his torn shirt-sleeves, "for
even he could no longer find means of getting
on in the new order of things."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P14"></a>14}</span>
</p>

<p>
How poor he was may be inferred from his
letter to the Minister of the Interior: "The
picture which I am painting for the government
is but half finished.  The situation in
which I find myself has forced me to ask you
to pay me part of the money in advance, so
that I may be enabled to finish the work.  I
have been honoured by your sympathy in all
my misfortunes; I have lost everything but
my talent and my courage.  I am seventy-five
years of age, and have not a single order for a
picture; indeed, this is the most painful moment
of my life.  You have a kind heart, and I flatter
myself that you will relieve me in accordance
with the urgency of my need."
</p>

<p>
"Well, Greuze," said his friend Barthélemy
one day to him, when sitting at his bedside.
</p>

<p>
"Well, my friend," replied the artist, "I am
dying....  I am commencing to know no
longer what I am saying; but patience! yet a
little while and I shall say nothing more."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Allons, mon ami</i>&mdash;courage, one doesn't die
on the first day of spring."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! my God, since the Sans-culottides I
have taken no heed of the seasons.  Are we in
<i>Ventóse</i> or in <i>Germinal</i>?  Is to-day Saint
<i>Pissenlit</i> or <i>Saint Asperge</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"What matters!  See how beautifully the
sun shines."
</p>

<p>
"I am quite at ease for my journey.  Adieu,
Barthelemy.  I await you at my burial.  You
will be all alone like the poor man's dog."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P15"></a>15}</span>
</p>

<p>
So in poverty and neglect the artist died.
There is a tradition that when Napoleon heard
of it, he exclaimed, "Dead! poor and neglected!
Why did he not speak?  I would have given
him a pitcher made of Sèvres china, filled to
the brim with gold, for every copy of his <i>Broken
Pitcher</i>."
</p>

<p>
At the funeral, when the coffin rested in the
church, a lady, whose emotion could not be
hidden, even by the thick veil which she wore,
advanced to the coffin, and placed upon it a
bouquet of <i>immortelles</i>.  She then withdrew
again to an obscure part of the church.  Tied
to the bouquet was discovered a piece of paper
which bore this inscription: "These flowers,
offered by the most grateful of his pupils, are
the emblem of his glory."
</p>

<p>
A newspaper of the time gave the name of
the young lady as Mademoiselle Mayer, the
artist who, before she committed suicide, did
so much to cheer the desolate life of Prudhon,
and who now occupies the same tomb as
Prudhon in the cemetery of Père la Chaise in
Paris.  Madame de Valory, however, the
god-daughter of Greuze, has stated that the woman
was Madame Jubot, another of the pupils of
Greuze.
</p>

<p>
Tournus neglected him in his life, but to-day
is proud of its illustrious son.  A monument of
the artist has been erected in the town, some
of his pictures hang in the church and in the
museum, and a tablet marks the house in which
he was born.

<h3>
ROMANCE AND TRAGEDY
</h3>

<p>
It was peculiarly fitting that a lady should
deposit upon the coffin of Greuze a bouquet
of <i>immortelles</i>, for his romantic and chivalrous
regard for women, from a very early period in
his career, had a great influence upon his life
and work.  Even as a pupil of Grandon, Greuze
fell in love with his master's wife, a woman of
very great beauty and charm.  He never told
his love; but one day Grandon's daughter
surprised Greuze on his knees in the studio.  She
asked him what he was doing there, and he
replied that he was looking for something he
had lost.  But she had seen that he had one of
her mother's shoes, and that he was covering it
with ardent kisses.
</p>

<p>
Exceptionally romantic, too, was his love for
the beautiful Lætitia during the two years that
he spent in Italy.  Greuze had carried with him
to that country letters of introduction to the
Duc del Or...., by whom he had been received
with great cordiality.  The Duke's wife had
died, but he had a charming daughter, Lætitia,
to whom it was arranged that Greuze should
give lessons in painting.  Greuze was a man
to whom women and girls were instinctively
attracted, and Lætitia fell in love with him,
with all the violence and passion of the Italian
temperament.  Her beauty and her charming
manners had also fascinated Greuze; but he
was very much disconcerted when he found
that she loved him, because he was conscious
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P17"></a>17}</span>
of the gulf which birth and fortune had placed
between them.  He, therefore, rigorously repressed
his desire to see her, and forced himself
to stay away from the palace.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, his doleful demeanour, innocent
face, and light curls obtained for him, from
Fragonard and other French students, who
were in Italy at the time, the name of the
love-sick cherub.
</p>

<p>
Greuze at length heard that Lætitia was ill,
and that no one could discover the cause or
nature of her malady.  He loitered near her
home to try to obtain tidings of her, and one
day he encountered the Duke, who took
him to the palace to show him two pictures
by Titian, which he had recently purchased.
</p>

<p>
"My daughter," he said, "has promised
herself the pleasure of copying them when her
health has been restored.  I hope that you will
come to superintend her work.  That is what
she wishes."
</p>

<p>
The Duke further asked Greuze to make a
copy of one of the pictures as soon as he could,
because he wished to send the copy away as a
present.  Greuze could not refuse; and thus he
was soon installed in the palace again, working
there day by day.  Each morning he was
informed, by an old retainer of the family, who
had been Lætitia's nurse, how the young lady
fared.  The old nurse knew the two were in
love with each other.  Indeed, a little later,
she arranged a secret interview between them,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P18"></a>18}</span>
and Greuze found his idol pale and thin, but
not less beautiful than before.
</p>

<p>
At first neither of them could speak; but,
encouraged by the nurse, Lætitia blurted out:
</p>

<p>
"Monsieur Greuze, I love you.  Tell me
frankly, do you love me?"
</p>

<p>
Greuze was too happy to speak, and Lætitia,
mistaking the cause of his silence, hid her face
in her hands, and burst into tears.
</p>

<p>
This melted Greuze to the uttermost.  He
threw himself at her feet, and then, in the
intervals between his impetuous kisses, he
poured out impassioned declarations of his love.
</p>

<p>
"I can now be happy," cried Lætitia,
clapping her hands, and behaving like a
gladdened child.  She ran and embraced her
nurse, and again and again gave expression
to her ecstasy.  "Listen to me, you two; here
is my scheme.  I love Greuze, and I will marry
him."
</p>

<p>
"My dear child, you dream," replied the
nurse.  "What about your father?"
</p>

<p>
"My nurse, you wish to say that my father
will not consent.  Well I know that.  He
wishes me to marry his eternal Casa&mdash;the
oldest and the ugliest of men; or the young
Count Palleri, whom I do not know, nor ever
wish to know.  I am rich through my mother,
and I give my fortune to Greuze, whom I
marry.  He takes me to France, and you will
follow us there."
</p>

<p>
And intoxicated with the future which she
had arranged, she detailed, with a delicious
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P19"></a>19}</span>
volubility, the life that they would lead together
in Paris.  Greuze would continue to paint.
He would become another Titian, and in the
end her father would be proud to have such
a son-in-law.
</p>

<p>
When Greuze next saw Lætitia he had had
time to review all the circumstances, and he
appeared with a woeful face.  Lætitia derided
him, and then tried to coax him tenderly out
of his gloomy mood.  At last, becoming angry,
she called him perfidious, and reproached him
that he had pretended to love her that he
might the more easily break her heart.  She
cried and tore her hair, and Greuze fell at her
feet, and promised to obey her blindly.
</p>

<p>
But as soon as he had left the palace he saw
the folly of it all.  He saw the despair of her
father, heard his maledictions, and felt his
vengeance, and all the misfortune which would
come upon their love.  He then decided that
he would not relent again, nor see Lætitia any
more.  As an excuse for not visiting her he
pretended that he was ill, and this simulated
illness became real.  For three months he was
ailing, and part of the time he was consumed
by fever and delirium.
</p>

<p>
At the end of his illness Lætitia was still
eager to marry him; but with extraordinary
firmness of will he resisted the temptation and
fled from Italy, carrying with him secretly a
copy of the portrait of Lætitia, which he had
painted for her father.
</p>

<p>
Many years later, when Greuze was once
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P20"></a>20}</span>
more a poor man, he wrote in reply to the
Grand Duchess of Russia, who had offered ten
thousand livres for the portrait of Lætitia, "If
you were to give me all the riches of the Empire
of Russia they would not pay for that picture,"
and probably in his old age he read yet again
the letter he had received from Lætitia, eight
years after he quitted Rome.  "Yes, my dear
Greuze, your old pupil is now a good mother;
I have five charming children, whom I adore.
My eldest daughter is worthy to be offered as a
subject for your happy talent; she is beautiful
as an angel.  Ask the Prince d'Este.  My
husband almost convinces me that I continue
to be young and pretty, so much does he still
love me.  As I have told you, this happiness
is due to you, and I love you for having
prevented me from loving you."
</p>

<p>
Greuze had scarcely returned from Italy
when he was attracted by Mademoiselle
Anne-Gabrielle Babuty, who was in charge of a
bookshop in Paris.  Diderot, who had himself been
very much in love with her, has described her
as a smart dashing young woman, of upright
carriage, and with a complexion of lilies and
roses.  De Goncourt also speaks of her
numerous charms.  She had a pretty face,
which Greuze seemed to be never tired of
painting.  It was the smooth face of a child,
and had an attractive roundness, and a soft,
tender, peach-like delicate complexion.  The
expression was simple and unaffected, and there
was enough of piquancy to animate a face
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P21"></a>21}</span>
which, for all its manifold good qualities, would
else have had a tendency towards insipidity.
Her eyebrows were very much arched, and this
circumstance lent to her face its expression of
naïveté.  Her eyelashes were long, and when
her eyes were downcast they gave a charming
look to her face, resting like a caress upon
her cheeks.  Her little nose, the nose of a child,
was exquisitely formed, and seemed to indicate
an alert and lively character, and her rosy lips
were also finely shaped, and particularly alluring.
</p>

<p>
Her portrait appears often in the paintings
of Greuze in <i>La Philosophie Endormie</i>, <i>La Mère
Bien Aimée</i>, <i>La Voluptueuse</i>, and in many others.
</p>

<p>
The story of their first encounter, and of
their subsequent relations, is best told by
a few extracts from a document which Greuze
had cause to execute some years afterwards.
He wrote:
</p>

<p>
"A few days after having arrived from Rome&mdash;I
know not by what fatality&mdash;I passed along
the <i>Rue Saint Jacques</i>, and saw in her shop
Mademoiselle Babuty, who was the daughter
of a bookseller.
</p>

<p>
"I was struck with admiration, for she had
a very beautiful figure; and that I might have
a better chance of seeing her I bought a
number of books.  Her face was without
character, and was indeed rather sheep-like.
I paid her as many compliments as she could
wish, and she knew who I was, for my reputation
had already commenced, and I had been
recognised by the Academy.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P22"></a>22}</span>
</p>

<p>
"She was then thirty and some odd years of
age, and therefore in danger of remaining single
all her life.  She employed all the cajoleries
that were possible to attach me to her, and to
cause me to come again, and I continued to pay
her visits for about a month.  One afternoon I
found her more animated than usual.  She took
one of my hands, and, regarding me with a very
passionate look, she said, 'Monsieur Greuze,
would you marry me if I were to consent?'
</p>

<p>
"I avow I was confounded by such a question.
I said to her, 'Mademoiselle, would not
one be too happy to pass his life with a woman
so lovable as you are?'
</p>

<p>
"Of course, this was but lightly said, yet
that did not prevent her from taking action at
once; for, upon the very next morning, she
went with her mother to the Quai des Orfèvres,
and there bought, at the shop of Monsieur
Strass, earrings of false diamonds, and next day
she did not hesitate to wear these in her ears.
</p>

<p>
"As she lived in a shop, the neighbours
were not slow in paying her compliments,
and in asking her who had presented these
jewels to her.
</p>

<p>
"With downcast eyes she answered softly,
'It is Monsieur Greuze who has given them
to me.'
</p>

<p>
"'You are married, then?'
</p>

<p>
"'Ah, no;' but this was said in a way that
implied that secretly she had married me.  My
friends began at once to congratulate me, but I
assured them there was nothing more false than
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P23"></a>23}</span>
the news they had heard, and that I had not
money enough to enable me to marry.
</p>

<p>
"Outraged at such effrontery, I did not
return to Mademoiselle Babuty any more.  I
lived at that time in <i>le faubourg Saint Germain</i>,
<i>rue du Petit Lion</i>, in an hotel of furnished rooms
called <i>l'Hôtel des Vignes</i>.  Three days passed,
during which I heard no more of the matter,
and I was already thinking of other affairs,
when one fine day she came knocking at my
door accompanied by her little servant girl.  I
took no notice of the knocks, but she knew I
was there, and she attacked my door with her
hands and feet like a veritable fury.  Then, to
prevent a public scandal, I opened my door,
and she threw herself into my room all in tears.
She said to me:
</p>

<p>
"'I have done wrong, Monsieur Greuze, but
it is love which has misled me.  It is the
attachment I have for you which has made me resort
to such a stratagem.  My life is in your
hands.'  Then she flung herself at my knees, and said
she would not rise again until I had promised
that I would marry her.  She took my two
hands in hers, and they were wet with tears.
I pitied her, and I promised all she wished.
</p>

<p>
"We were not married until two years afterwards,
in the parish of Saint Medard&mdash;which
was not her parish&mdash;for fear of the pleasantries
that would have been made, seeing that she
had said that we were already married.  I
commenced housekeeping with twenty-six livres the
day after our wedding."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P24"></a>24}</span>
</p>

<p>
During the first seven years of their married
life they had three children.  One of the
children died, leaving the artist and his wife
with two daughters.
</p>

<p>
Concerning these seven years no complaint
is made about the conduct of Madame Greuze;
but from that time it would be difficult to find
a more unhappy household than that of Greuze.
His wife was a continual torment, hindering
him in his work, putting his life on a lower
level, and making his home intolerable.  Diderot
even blamed her for the infelicity of his Academy
picture, and Greuze himself suspected her of
having poisoned the minds of the members of
the Academy against him.
</p>

<p>
Her faithlessness, gross as it was, received
further aggravation from the insolent openness
in which it manifested itself.  She received men
of the most disreputable character at her house,
caring naught whether her husband knew or
not; and she polluted the morals of his boy
pupils.  Her children she neglected and put
into a convent, one for eleven years, and the
other for twelve.  "It is a year and seven days
since mamma saw us," said one of the girls
sadly one day, when their father had gone to
visit them.
</p>

<p>
Many a time Greuze went in bodily fear of
her violence.  When she asked for the help of
a servant, and Greuze suggested that she should
wait a little longer, until he could pay the
wages of one, she dealt him, with all her might,
a blow upon his face.  She squandered in all
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P25"></a>25}</span>
manner of foolish extravagance the large
fortune which Greuze received from the sale of
the engravings from his works; and then she
destroyed his account books, that the extent of
her defalcations might never be known.  Her
household duties were abandoned, and Greuze
nearly died when one day he warmed for himself
some food in a saucepan in which verdigris
had been suffered to accumulate.
</p>

<p>
At last her violence, her rank immorality, her
extravagance and her neglect could be borne no
longer, and in despair Greuze obtained from the
magistrates the legal right to live apart from
his wife.

<h3>
PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS
</h3>

<p>
The sadness of the story of Greuze's married
life is all the more touching because he had the
qualities of a true and tender husband.  It is
indeed not less than a tragedy that, constituted
as he was, he should have been denied the
companionship of a woman worthy of the great
affection of which his nature was capable.
Often querulous and brusque with men, his
manner with women was gracious and respectful,
his politeness the true politeness of the
kind heart that desires the well-being of others.
As we have seen, his relations with Lætitia
were governed by a most chivalrous ideal of
conduct, an ideal which seems quite quixotic
when we think of the period in which he lived.
As Lætitia had been attracted towards him, so
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P26"></a>26}</span>
also were most of the women who moved in his
social sphere; and, eager as he was for praise
from men, it came with added sweetness from
the lips of women.  It is not surprising that
he painted women with such perfect charm,
because his heart was in the work.
</p>

<p>
Greuze, though only of middle height, had
yet an impressive personality; and people of
any discernment saw at a glance that he was
a man of distinction.  His head was well
formed, his forehead high, his eyes large and
bright, and of a good shape, and his features
indicated genius, candour, and an energetic
will.
</p>

<p>
His conversation was sincere and elevated,
and often piquant and animated.  He sometimes
showed signs of nervousness and irritability,
and became quite fiery when his work
was criticised, or when he thought he was
not receiving the treatment which his vanity
prompted him to think he ought to receive.
</p>

<p>
This self-esteem, always abnormal, had been
increased by his early success with <i>Un Père de
Famille qui lit la Bible à ses Enfants</i>.  "Our
painter is a little vain," wrote Diderot in 1765,
"but his vanity is that of a child;" and it was
generally recognised that there was very much
of naïveté in his conceit, and that his good
qualities compensated for any displays of childish
self-sufficiency.
</p>

<p>
At times his talk became inflated and
bombastic.  "Oh, sir!" he would say, concerning
his own picture, "here is a work which
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P27"></a>27}</span>
astonishes even me who painted it.  I cannot
understand how a man can, with a few pounded
earths, animate a canvas in this way," and no
ridicule could cure him of this flamboyant
manner.
</p>

<p>
"That is beautiful," said Monsieur de
Marigny, standing before Greuze's painting of
<i>La Pleureuse</i>.
</p>

<p>
"Sir, I know it; moreover, people praise
me, and yet I am in need of more commissions."
</p>

<p>
"It is because you have a host of enemies,"
said Vernet, who was present at the time, "and
amongst those enemies is one who appears to
love you to the verge of folly, but he will
nevertheless ruin you."
</p>

<p>
"And who is that?"
</p>

<p>
"It is yourself."
</p>

<p>
Greuze's irritability sometimes revealed
itself in downright rudeness.  Natoire, the
professor at the Academy, looking through a
portfolio of drawings of some other artist,
questioned the accuracy of one of the figures,
whereupon Greuze turned upon him and said:
</p>

<p>
"Sir, you would be happy if you could draw
one as well."
</p>

<p>
The Dauphin, when Greuze had painted his
portrait, wishing to show how pleased he was
with Greuze's work, paid him the high compliment
of suggesting that he should now paint
the portrait of the Dauphine, who was present.
Greuze looked at her face, and alluding to the
thick covering of rouge which appeared upon
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P28"></a>28}</span>
her cheeks, asked to be excused, for he could
not paint such a face as that.  No wonder
that Mariette should say that Greuze had the
manners of a cobbler.
</p>

<p>
There are also hints that Greuze was sometimes
jealous.  In <i>Un Homme d'Autrefois</i>, by
the Marquis Costa de Beauregard, it has been
narrated that Henry Costa, one of the author's
ancestors, wishing to be an artist, went at the
age of fourteen years to Paris.  He was
received with great kindness by Greuze, and
the enthusiastic boy said "<i>il parle comme un
ange</i>," but in an article contributed by Augustus
Mansion to <i>Temple Bay</i> we have read, "Another
chagrin followed.  Greuze became jealous of
his prodigy, tried to shake him off, ignored
letters, and declined to permit himself to be
seen at work.  It was an unkindness keenly
felt by the boy, who was learning every day a
little more of the world: '<i>Quelle froideur et quelle
mystère!</i>' he says.  'Greuze told me he could
not communicate certain processes he was
employing, that what was useful for him might
not be the same for me.  I cannot understand
how a fine genius can be capable of such
meanness.'"
</p>

<p>
Yet one cannot estimate the whole character
of Greuze by these isolated incidents.  Like
other people, he said and did different things
when he was in different moods, and we know
that when the artists of Paris held aloof from
Prudhon, whose poverty had compelled him to
"draw vignettes on letter sheets for the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P29"></a>29}</span>
government offices, business cards for tradesmen, and
even little pictures for bon-bonnières...
Greuze alone treated him amicably."
</p>

<p>
Greuze's industry was abnormal.  As a
worker he seemed indefatigable.  He was
absorbed in his art, putting all his soul and
brains into his pictures, and seeming to live
for his work, and for no other thing.

<h3>
CHARACTERISTICS OF HIS WORK
</h3>

<p>
There is so little variety in the works of
Greuze that if one divides them into two
main classes, nearly all his pictures, with the
exception of the portraits, may be placed in one
or other of these two divisions.  In one class there
are his <i>genre</i> pictures, containing as a rule many
figures; and then, better known than these,
and of greater merit, are his single heads of
girls and boys, which constitute the other
principal category.
</p>

<p>
His first great success was achieved with his
picture of the <i>genre</i> class, <i>Un Père de Famille qui
lit la Bible à ses Enfants</i>, and this book contains
an illustration from another popular work of
this sort called <i>L'Accordée de Village</i>.  A section
of this volume explains the relative position of
Greuze in the history of art, and reasons are
given which account for the great acclamation
with which this and similar works were received
in Paris when first they were exhibited.
Meanwhile we will consider the intrinsic merits of
these pictures without reference to the novelty
of their appearance&mdash;an appearance in which
a number of adventitious circumstances are
involved.
</p>

</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P31"></a>31}</span>
</p>

<p>
In painting pictures of scenes in the life of
humble people, Greuze had an aim other than
the representation of some beauty of nature by
which his own emotions had been profoundly
stirred.  He wished to play the schoolmaster,
and the history of painting has demonstrated
that, whatever may be the immediate effect of
pictures that have been wrought in this mood,
they have never been the pictures that have
endured for all time the test of a comparison
with the severest standards of excellence in
art, and they have invariably sunk into their
own place&mdash;amongst pictures not in the first
class.
</p>

<p>
Again and again it has been shown that a
man cannot be a preacher or a story-writer on
canvas and at the same time an artist of the
first rank.  The reason for this is that it is not
the function of pictorial art to tell tales, nor to
preach sermons, though artists can do both,
and yet be very popular.
</p>

<p>
"Sir," said Dr. Johnson, "a woman's preaching
is like a dog's walking on his hind legs: it
is not done well; but you are surprised to find
it done at all."  And one may apply the same
remark to the pulpiteering of the painter with
much less risk of evoking a protest.
</p>

<p>
During recent years this truth has begun to
receive recognition.  Théophile Gautier has
written strenuously against story-telling
pictures, and Whistler has argued that Art "is,
withal, selfishly occupied with her own
perfection only&mdash;having no desire to teach&mdash;seeking
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P32"></a>32}</span>
and finding the beautiful in all conditions and
in all times."
</p>

<p>
While these opinions of modern critics upon
anecdotal art are in our minds, it will be
appropriate to mention Greuze's own views
as revealed in what he called "<i>une note
historique</i>" upon his painting of <i>La Belle-Mère</i>.
"For a long time I had wished," he says, "to
paint that character, but in each sketch the
expression of the stepmother always appeared
to me to be feeble and unsatisfactory.  One
day, however, when I was crossing the
Pont-Neuf, I saw two women, who spoke to one
another with much vehemence.  One of them
began to shed tears, and she exclaimed, 'Such
a stepmother too!  Yes, she gave me bread,
but in giving it to me she broke my teeth.'  That
was a <i>coup de lumière</i> for me; I returned
to the house, and I made the sketch for my
picture, which contains five figures: the
step-mother, the daughter of the dead mother, the
grandmother of the orphan, the daughter of
the stepmother, and a child of three years.  I
have supposed in my picture that it is the
dinner-hour, and that the poor little girl goes
to take a seat at the table with the other
children.  Then the stepmother takes a piece
of bread from the table, and, holding the
orphan back by her apron, thrusts the bread
roughly into her mouth.  I have set myself
the task of showing in that action the deliberate
hate of the woman.  The child seeks to evade
her stepmother's violence, and seems as one
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P33"></a>33}</span>
who would say, 'Why would you ill-use me?
I have done you no harm.'  The child's expression
is a mixture of shyness and of fear.  Her
grandmother is at the other end of the table.
Harrowed by grief, she lifts her eyes to heaven,
and, with hands trembling, seems to say, 'Ah! my
daughter, where are you?  What misfortunes! what
bitterness!'  The daughter of
the stepmother, not at all sympathetic concerning
the lot of her sister, laughs to witness the
despair of the poor old woman, and, in ridicule,
draws her mother's attention to her gestures.
The infant of the family, whose heart has not
yet been corrupted, gratefully stretches out her
arms towards the sister who has bestowed so
much kindness upon her.  I have wished to
paint a woman who maltreats a child that
does not belong to her, and who, by a double
crime, has also corrupted the heart of her own
daughter."
</p>

<p>
Here, then, we see an anecdotal painting in
the making.  Although this rehearsal is very
touching, as a revelation of the kind heart of
the man, it yet seems to-day a particularly
naïve exposition of the motive for a work of
art.  Nothing could show with greater clearness
the wide gulf that, in the art world, lies between
the end of the eighteenth century and the end
of a century which closed with discussions of
the theories of impressionists, vibrists,
symbolists and pointillists, and with the theories of
those who, denying that art is primarily moral,
or even intellectual, have contended that it is
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P34"></a>34}</span>
simply a means by which we are made to
respond to an artist's emotion.
</p>

<p>
If Whistler, to mention an artist representative
of some newer movements than those of
the eighteenth century, had been on the Pont-Neuf,
from what a different source would have
come any <i>coup de lumière</i> which might have
flashed into his brain!  Not during high noon,
nor in the gossip of the people, would he have
found the motive for his paintings.  His <i>coup de
lumière</i> would have come "when the evening
mist clothes the riverside with poetry, as with
a veil, and the buildings lose themselves in
the dim sky, and the tall chimneys become
campanili, and the warehouses are palaces in the
night, and the whole city hangs in the heavens,
and fairyland is before us&mdash;then the wayfarer
hastens home; and the working man and the
cultured one, the wise man and the one of
pleasure, cease to understand, as they have
ceased to see, and Nature, who, for once, has
sung in tune, sings her exquisite song to the
artist alone, her son and her master&mdash;her son
in that he loves her, her master in that he
knows her."
</p>

<p>
Whistler's eyes would have been directed
towards the beauties of colour and of tone that
he might find on the river or on its banks; and
the Isle de France, as it is seen by the tired
journalist as he makes his way to the Latin
Quarter at dawn of day, with its tender grays,
and its evasive charms of exquisite light and
colour, would be of more account to him than
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P35"></a>35}</span>
all the conversations in the world, however
vehement they might be.  The idea of preaching
or moralizing on canvas would never have
entered his head for a moment.
</p>

<p>
When Greuze, in harmony with the raw
notions of Diderot upon art, did preach, his
homilies were singularly unimpressive.  The
pictures which he painted when in this
sermonizing vein have all the elements that go
to the making of what is now called melodrama.
The scenes are not the result of a
discriminating observation of real life; are not,
to use Zola's phrase, "Nature seen through a
temperament."  They are founded upon
conventions, upon the artificial and sentimental
ideas of life that have by some curious freak
of the human mind established themselves in
books and plays and pictures.
</p>

<p>
The figures in Greuze's <i>genre</i> pictures pose
before the spectators; they gesticulate and
overdo their parts like barn-stormers.  Pity
becomes maudlin, morality degenerates into
sanctimoniousness, and humility is degraded
into utter abasement.  The sentimentality in
<i>Un Paralytique Soigné par sa Famille</i>, <i>ou le Fruit de
la Bonne Education</i>, and in <i>La Mère Paralytique</i> is
particularly nauseating, and in <i>La Mère bien
Aimée</i> the exaggeration of what is in actual
life a very tender sentiment makes of that
picture a very significant example of Greuze's
stilted manner.  The six children&mdash;all of them
about the same age&mdash;who have flung themselves
upon their mother, seem so numerous,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P36"></a>36}</span>
and are so involved in a confused heap of
humanity that Madame Geoffrin spoke of the
picture as a "fricassee of children," and
incurred thereby the fulminations of the artist.
In his <i>genre</i> pictures, too, as is usual in
melodrama elsewhere, the humble cottage is the
headquarters of all the virtues.
</p>

<p>
Greuze, it is true, made sketches for his
pictures in the streets and in the market-places;
but there is none of the freshness of
the sketch when the figure appears on the
canvas, and De Goncourt has complained
that little tatterdemalions with their split
breeches have become on their way to Greuze's
canvases the Cupids of Boucher dressed as
Savoyards; and further, he has put in a mild
demurrer that the artist's washerwomen do not
wash!
</p>

<p>
In strong contrast to Greuze's melodramatic,
affected, domestic scenes are those by Chardin,
another French artist of the eighteenth century.
No ethical teaching is obtruded in his pictures;
there is no pose, and the spectator can enjoy
the real poetry of life, the sweetness and
simplicity of well-ordered homes, undisturbed by
the poseurs who clamour for our regard in many
of the pictures by Greuze.
</p>

<br>
THE PRETTY LAUNDRESS.<br>(La Belle Blanchisseuse.)
</p>

<p>
Another fault of Greuze's <i>genre</i> pictures is
their poverty and feebleness of colour.  There
is a general deadness, and in parts an abuse of
purple and violet.  Some of the tints have a
dirty muddled look, and the shadows are heavy
and brown.  Still the chief fault is that art in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P37"></a>37}</span>
these pictures is relegated to a second place;
the pictures are a means, and not an end.
</p>

<p>
To see many of his <i>genre</i> pictures together is
to receive an impression of monotony.  It is
clear that the range of the artist is narrow,
that he is making a few ideas cover a great
area of canvas, and that he ceased to grow
intellectually at an early stage of his career.
</p>

<p>
Greuze and Hogarth have often been compared,
but there are many essential differences
between the two men.  There was dissimilarity
in their temperaments, and while Greuze has
adopted the attitude of a mild-mannered
Sabbath-school superintendent, towards those
whose immorality he would correct, Hogarth,
as Professor Muther has written, has "swung
over this human animal the stout cudgel of
morality in the manner of a sturdy policeman
and Puritan <i>bourgeois</i>."  Charles Normand
explains the difference with some disregard for
international amenity.  Greuze, he says, "did
not paint for the English, at once drunkards
and theologians, maundering on through life,
with a pot of gin in one hand and a Bible in
the other."
</p>

<p>
And yet Greuze is no Puritan, even when
he preaches most.  There is often an air of
coquetry and voluptuousness in his most serious
pictures.  Charles Blanc has written that Greuze
is a moralist who is passionately fond of beautiful
shoulders, a preacher who loves to see and to
reveal to us the bosoms of young girls; and
Lady Dilke has pointed out that "even in <i>Un
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P38"></a>38}</span>
Père de Famille qui lit la Bible à ses Enfants</i>
... the instinct which bade him associate with his
lessons of grace and morality the stimulus of
voluptuous charm has tempted him to give
prominence to the girl whose thoughts are far
away, and whose kerchief is torn just where it
should hide the budding breast."
</p>

<p>
But when criticism has said all it can say in
dispraise of Greuze's pictures, even of his <i>genre</i>
pictures, it may be seen that Greuze was by
temperament an artist.  The melodramatic
moralist was only part of the man and not the
whole.  Even Robert Louis Stevenson had
"something of the Shorter-Catechist" in his
constitution, and yet remains the most romantic
and interesting figure of the latter-day world of
letters.
</p>

<p>
It need not be forgotten that in the most
theatrical works of Greuze there are many
beauties.  There is often a figure in these
otherwise imperfect pictures which indicates his
love for the beautiful, and in some of his paintings,
for instance in <i>Un Père de Famille qui lit
la Bible à ses Enfants</i>, the melodramatic element,
though present, is not obtrusive, and is more
than compensated by the other qualities of
tenderness and graceful composition.
</p>

<p>
We may now consider the other class of
Greuze's paintings, the heads of children, and
it is in these that Greuze is seen at his best;
it is in these that he redeems himself, and reveals
more of the artist.  To-day, though his other
works are scarcely ever mentioned, his heads
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P39"></a>39}</span>
of girls and boys are treasured in the most
costly collections, and are known far and wide
by means of photographs and other reproductions.
</p>

<p>
In many an art gallery the beautiful eyes of
these pretty, rosy-cheeked children meet our
own, and we stay yet again to admire their
fresh lips and their brown hair, in which the
piece of blue ribbon nestles with such harmony
of colouring.  Often a light gauze has been
thrown round their necks or upon their shoulders,
and often, too, a posy of flowers tucked into the
tops of their bodices emulates the carnation
and white of their complexions.  There are few
pictures that are more sweet and alluring than
these heads of children.
</p>

<p>
In London it is an easy matter to study
Greuze's child portraits, because there are a
few examples at the National Gallery, and
more at Hertford House.  Standing before
these canvases the general effect is one of
sweetness and delicacy, one colour melting into
another in almost imperceptible gradations, and
giving an impression very unlike the one we
receive from the hard edges of a painting by
Maclise for example.  The colours are not
positive, but have been softened and harmonized.
For instance, if a piece of white paper is held
against what may seem to be a piece of white
drapery, it will be found that the white has
been modified into a beautiful delicate pearly
gray.  The same test may be applied to the
other colours.  Hold a piece of positive blue
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P40"></a>40}</span>
near to one of Greuze's seemingly blue ribbons,
and it will be noticed that a similar modification
has been effected.
</p>

<p>
The forms, too, have been rounded, and have
been freed from all angularities.  Indeed,
Greuze has carried this process as far as it is
possible.  Too much of this smoothing and the
picture would lose in character, and would
become but a vapid piece of work.
</p>

<br>

<br>
THE LISTENING GIRL.
</p>

<p>
In the long series of heads of girls and boys
that Greuze painted, some of the pictures are
conspicuously better than the rest.  Of these
may be mentioned the <i>Head of a Young Girl
Veiled in Black</i>, which belongs to M. Leopold
Goldschmidt, and two more which are in the
Museum at Besançon, <i>Paul Strogonoff</i>, <i>Infant</i>,
and the <i>Head of a Young Girl</i>.  Also characteristic
of Greuze at his best, and more available
to the people of this country, is <i>A Girl with
Doves</i>.  In the year 1800 he exhibited at the
Salon <i>L'Innocence tenant Deux Pigeons</i>.  It has
not been definitely ascertained, but it is possible
that this is the beautiful picture that hangs now
in the Wallace Gallery.  Few paintings by
Greuze are more pleasing than this one.  The
picture is well painted, and it is quite free from
Greuze's besetting sins.  Where in other pictures
one finds posturing and affectation, one
finds here the simplicity and sweetness of
nature.  The painting was a commission from
a Mr. Wilkinson, and Greuze received 4,500
francs for it.  When Mr. Wilkinson's pictures
were sold in 1828, Mr. Nieuwenhuys became
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P41"></a>41}</span>
the purchaser, and he paid 245 guineas for the
painting.  Later the work became the property
of Mr. W. Wells, of Redleaf, and when, in
1848, his pictures were dispersed, the Marquis
of Hertford gave £787 10s. for this one, and
thus it has become part of the splendid
collection at Hertford House, now belonging to the
nation.  During the Manchester Exhibition of
1857 the public had a chance to see it there,
and it was exhibited again at Bethnal Green in
1874.  Another picture in which Greuze's style
may be studied is <i>A Girl's Head, draped with a
Scarf</i>.  In England this is one of the
best-known of the artist's works.  Thirty and more
years ago it was reproduced in popular
publications, and it has been reproduced many times
since by various processes.  By the bequest of
Mr. R. Simmons, the original picture has
become the property of the nation, and it is now
the most characteristic example of Greuze
amongst those that hang in the National
Gallery.  Upon this canvas one may see many
of the qualities to which we have already
referred.  There is more than a suspicion of
mannerism in the way that the hands are held,
and one feels, concerning the shoulder, that,
beautiful as it is, it has been obtruded upon the
notice of the spectator with a somewhat free
anatomical license.  The half-open mouth also
gives an impression of affectation; and yet,
when criticism has pronounced its last word,
the picture still remains graceful and seductive.
</p>

<p>
Some of the faults of Greuze's manner which
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P42"></a>42}</span>
have been noted in his <i>genre</i> pictures appear
also in his heads of children.  The girls in a
number of the pictures are too self-conscious
and affected, imperfections that one may see
prominently illustrated in <i>Fidelity</i> and in <i>Ariadne</i>,
in the Wallace Collection.
</p>

<p>
A few, indeed, of Greuze's heads can scarcely
be called paintings of children at all, so many
of the elements of womanhood has he mingled
with what is otherwise typical of childhood.
As representations of the charm and the
insouciance of childhood, a painting by Greuze
would ill bear comparison, for example, with
a work by Chardin amongst his own
compatriots, with works by Reynolds and
Gainsborough; or, to come to our time, with
some of the children of Millais, with Watts'
<i>Agathoniké Hélène Ionides</i>, Whistler's <i>Miss
Alexander</i>, Mouat Loudan's <i>Isa</i>, John Lavery's
<i>A Girl in White</i>, or with Edward Arthur
Walton's <i>The Girl in Brown</i>.
</p>

<p>
Most of the French critics who have written
of Greuze have drawn attention to this imperfection
in the artist's paintings of children.  De
Goncourt in some passages of searching criticism
has written regarding a number of these
heads that they represent "the innocence of
Paris and of the eighteenth century, an easy
innocence which is near its fall."  And De
Goncourt, Diderot, and other writers have pointed
out that in many the head is the head of a girl
on the body of a woman; that Greuze has, in
fact, put "young heads on old shoulders."
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P43"></a>43}</span>
Charles Blanc has written of <i>Une Jeune Fille
qui pleure la Mort de son Oiseau</i>, that the head is
the head of a child, but the grief is the grief of
a woman; and he has added to this criticism
that it is rare to find in Greuze's pictures of
this class the head in harmony with the body.
</p>

<p>
Despite all these shortcomings, however, the
pictures are charming, but the appeal of Greuze
will be specially to the young, who mark the
beauty only, and are unconscious of any pose
or any incongruity.
</p>

<p>
In addition to the kinds of paintings we have
mentioned, Greuze showed that he was not
quite free from the conventions of the period
by painting a few mythological, religious, and
allegorical works, but these are pictures which
are not of any importance.
</p>

<p>
"Keep yourself free from formulas," he said
to Count Henry Costa, but therein he did not
follow his own bidding.  A writer in the <i>Nouvelle
Biographie Générale</i> has recorded that during this
era it was accepted and taught that a sphere
should be represented as though it had many
sides.  Greuze at one time accepted this absurd
dogma, and in some of his pictures the chubby
cheeks of children have been painted as though
they had facets.  His most finished works,
however, are free from this blemish.  Greuze's
desire to be an historical painter is more
evidence that he was not without the conventional
ideas which have strangled art with such
persistency.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P44"></a>44}</span>
</p>

<p>
Although Greuze sometimes sketched rapidly,
yet his works are usually the result of slow and
laborious effort renewed again and again.  His
plan was to return to his picture when he was
at his best, and to paint and repaint, no matter
how often, until he felt that the work was as
free from faults as he could make it.

<h3>
HIS POSITION IN FRENCH ART
</h3>

<p>
During the seventeenth century France
had not an art of her own.  The native
painters derived their pictures from Roman or
Grecian traditions.  They shut their eyes upon
the beauties of Nature, painted tedious repetitions
of other people's notions, and could not
so much as paint their own King, Louis XIV.,
except as Cyrus or as Alexander!
</p>

<p>
This period of dulness, pomposity, and
general boredom was succeeded by one of light
and gaiety, when the joy and the colour of life
received recognition.  To this consummation
the supreme genius of Watteau contributed
some of the most exquisite and poetical pictures
of all time, and delivered France "from the
oppressive yoke of the Italian tradition."  Watteau
had many imitators, and his style
dominated art for many years, but eventually
freedom degenerated into license, and even into
sheer obscenity.  Count Henry Costa, visiting
Paris during this period, wrote in a letter to his
parents in Savoy: "Greuze, I think, is not
partial to Boucher; and rightly loathes the
filthiness in fashion now, which desecrates art
and ruins morality."  Boucher he described as
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P46"></a>46}</span>
"an old worldling, more dissipated and done
up than you can imagine."
</p>

<p>
It is in the writings of Diderot that one can
see, as well as in any other place, an indication
that towards the end of the eighteenth century
influential people in France were growing more
and more studious and serious.  The ideas of
Rousseau were taking possession of the minds
of other people.  The nation must study Nature,
and discover her laws.  Prejudices, authority,
tradition, must all be examined in the light of
this new idea.  Vice must be subdued, artificiality,
insincerity, luxury, false refinements, must
be swept away, and the people must return to
a life of greater simplicity.  Man, by nature
moral, had been corrupted by civilization, and
it was therefore the least civilized who were the
least corrupt.
</p>

<p>
Ideas like these, set forth with the power and
the burning zeal of Rousseau, and with the
deftness of Diderot, had prepared the minds of
the Parisians to receive the <i>genre</i> pictures of
Greuze, for to some extent he is an advocate
of these ideas in his pictures, seeing that virtues
are attributed in a generous measure to the
poor and downtrodden of the people.
</p>

<p>
It is thus that, breaking away from the style
of the painters who did little more than pander
to the French Court, the pictures of Greuze
mark with perfect clearness the beginning of a
new tendency which was making itself felt in
Paris at the end of the eighteenth century.
Instead of adding to the great store of <i>fêtes
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P47"></a>47}</span>
galantes</i>, and the triumphs of love of the time,
Greuze looked for his subjects upon the quays,
and boulevards, and market-places, and in the
cottages of humble people.
</p>

<p>
"Courage, my good Greuze," said Diderot
of one of Greuze's pictures of domestic drama;
"introduce morality into painting.  What! has
not the palette been long enough, and too long,
consecrated to debauchery and vice?  Ought
we not to be delighted at seeing it at last, united
with dramatic poetry, in instructing, correcting
us, and inviting us to virtue?"
</p>

<p>
Living amidst such ideas as these, Greuze
founded in France, in the words of De Goncourt,
"the deplorable school of the literary
painter, and the moralizing artist," or of "that
barbaric, story-telling art," as Muther, writing
in a similar strain, has described it.
</p>

<p>
It was this manner of painting that brought
out what similarity there is between Hogarth
and Greuze, who has been called "a sentimental
Hogarth."  Like the painter of <i>The
Rake's Progress</i>, Greuze told moral tales in a
series of pictures in which virtue is exalted and
vice abashed, a kind of painting quite different
from the pictures which had hitherto been
exhibited in Paris.  Truly, as Charles Normand
has written, "the hour of the reaction against
the pastorals and the mythological insipidities
of Boucher had sounded.  It was Greuze who
was the pioneer in the new departure, and he
reaped the reward.  His fault is that he
replaced one convention by another."  Hitherto
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P48"></a>48}</span>
the Court had been all in all, but now had
arrived, in the phrase of Charles Blanc,
"l'usurpation bourgeoise."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Yet though Greuze thus parted from his
predecessors, and, at his best, went along the
line of progress towards a study of Nature at
first hand, he brought about no violent change
such as was seen in England when Madox
Brown and the Pre-Raphaelites broke in upon
the complacent mediocrities who represented
art in England during early Victorian times.
</p>

<p>
Though he preached against the ardent
sensuality of his era, his own pictures were not
wholly free from it, and in the collection at
Hertford House his <i>L'Offrande a l'Amour</i>, and
particularly <i>La Bacchante</i>, strike no new note
amongst the other paintings of the same period.
There is not the great difference that would be
noticed if an early Millais were to be hung
amidst a collection of the works of Maclise,
Landseer, Collins, Newton, Leslie, Mulready,
and Webster.  Greuze did not free France in
the same way that the Pre-Raphaelites loosed
the bonds of convention and tradition in our
own country.
</p>

<p>
Greuze founded no school, and indeed outlived
his own movement; for he and Fragonard
were left in hopeless isolation when the
Revolution overwhelmed France.  There are few
more pathetic passages in the lives of painters
than those which relate how, for the sake of
their daily bread, these poor old men made
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P49"></a>49}</span>
ineffectual attempts, Fragonard with his <i>Le
Grand Prêtre Corésus se sacrifie pour sauver
Callirrhoé</i>, and Greuze with his <i>Ariadne at Naxos</i>, to
adapt themselves to the new situation.
</p>

<p>
The Revolution, so far from freeing art in
France, brought about, under David&mdash;excellent
as he was as a painter of portraits&mdash;a reaction
to a "barren, wearisome classicism," represented
by pictures which are now absolutely
without attraction.  Instead of studying Nature,
the painters studied the statues and the friezes
of the ancients.  They became antiquaries and
geometricians, and left the open air to weary
themselves in musty libraries, in the pursuit
of archæological accuracy.  Formulas and
conventions, traditions and self-constituted
authority were once more exalted upon pedestals,
and the century which opened with the
"pipes and timbrels" of Watteau closed with
the prosing of the most tedious bores.
</p>

<p>
So successfully did David put back the clock,
that it was not until the nineteenth century was
nearly thirty years of age that the artists of
France, inspired, as we love to think, by our
own John Constable, issued from the house
of bondage to study Nature in the forest of
Fontainebleau.

<h3>
OUR ILLUSTRATIONS
</h3>

<p>
<i>The Kiss</i> (<i>Le Baiser Jeté</i>).&mdash;Although this
work has not been reproduced so many
times as <i>La Cruche Cassée</i>, it yet ranks with that
painting as one of the most fascinating of the
works of Greuze.  A young woman looks from
the window of her room.  She has received a
letter from the hands of her lover, to whom
she throws a kiss as he departs.  In his
treatment of this subject Greuze has shown that
it was not a lack of capacity that caused him
sometimes to lapse into melodrama.  His acute
feeling for what is beautiful has been expressed
on this canvas with remarkable skill.  Writing
of the painting in 1765, Diderot called it "a
charming picture," and Charles Normand, in
giving a description of the work, has written:
"The eighteenth century, amorous and
unrestrained, has been made to live again in that
woman, who, her eyes full of longing, her
mouth partly opened, her throat scarcely veiled
by a light gauze, throws from her window a
kiss to her lover.  The seductive shapeliness
of her neck, the expression of love, the hand
carried tenderly to her lips, the whole effect of
her beautiful figure, which palpitates at the
sight of her lover, justifies the title of <i>La
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P51"></a>51}</span>
Voluptueuse</i> which the painter has also given to
the picture."  A copy of this painting, by
C. Turner, was sold in London in 1902 for £136.

<p>
<i>The Village Bride</i> (<i>L'Accordée de Village</i>).&mdash;This
is the short title of the work "Un Mariage
à l'instant où le père de l'accordée délivre la dot
à son gendre."  The first title was <i>Un Père qui
vient de payer la dot de sa Fille</i>.  The scene is a
great country kitchen, which has a freedom from
furniture that is refreshing in these days of
senseless overcrowding.  Stone steps lead from the
kitchen to an upper chamber.  A shelf, a gun,
a lantern, a great cupboard, and a few chairs
and a table, would almost complete an inventory
of the movables.  Twelve people, arranged
as though they were on the stage of a theatre,
or for a <i>tableau vivant</i>, take part in the scene.
The parish official, sitting at a small table, has
registered the marriage, and one of the children
toys with the document.  The father of the
bride, a venerable old man with white hair,
has just handed to his son-in-law a small
leather bag, containing his daughter's marriage
portion, and he is now holding forth in true
melodramatic style, his face to the gallery,
and, as one may fancy, the limelight streaming
on his head.  The bridegroom, a tall, handsome
fellow, listens in a respectful attitude;
and the pretty bride, whose eyes are downcast,
has her arm linked in his, and the fingers of
one hand are laid lovingly upon one of his
hands.  Her other arm is held by her mother,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P52"></a>52}</span>
a comely matron, dressed in simple and
picturesque attire.  The bride's sisters and
brother watch with intense interest, except
one little girl of five or six years, who feeds
a hen and chickens on the kitchen floor.
Another sister has her head upon the bride's
shoulder, and a third is weeping.  In the
incident of one of the chickens, balanced on
the edge of the dish of water, trying its wings,
some writers have seen an allegorical reference
to the marriage.  It is said that the head of
the bride is a portrait of Mademoiselle Ducreux
when she was fifteen years of age.  In this
painting Greuze's tendency to cause his figures
to assume self-conscious poses is apparent;
but there is not so much of theatricality here
as to spoil the picture, and thus one may still
derive some pleasure from a contemplation of
the scene.  It is interesting to remember that
this is the picture which caused such a sensation
during the last few days of the Salon of
1761.  It was bought by Monsieur de Marigny
for 3,000 livres, and at the sale of his pictures,
twenty years later, the price paid for it was
16,650 livres.  The picture is now in the
Louvre in Paris.  It has often been reproduced.
During the life of the artist it was
engraved by Flipart, and then was reproduced
in colours by Alix.  Greuze also painted a
replica of the picture.

ROBESPIERRE.
</p>

<p>
<i>Portrait of Maximilien Marie Isidore Robespierre</i>.&mdash;In
John Morley's "Critical Miscellanies"
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P53"></a>53}</span>
we are told that "In the Salon of 1791 an
artist exhibited Robespierre's portrait, simply
inscribing it <i>The Incorruptible</i>.  Throngs passed
before it every day, and ratified the honourable
designation by eager murmurs of approval.
The democratic journals were loud in panegyric
on the unsleeping sentinel of liberty.
They loved to speak of him as the modern
Fabricius, and delighted to recall the words of
Pyrrhus, that it is easier to turn the sun from
its course than to turn Fabricius from the path
of honour."  Mr. A. G. Temple, F.S.A., has
written recently that efforts have been made to
identify the Salon portrait with this one, but
unsuccessfully.  Robespierre's ancestors were
Irish people, but he was born at Arras.  After
a successful career as a lawyer he became a
member of the States-General, and Mirabeau
prophesied, "That young man believes what
he says; he will go far."  Carlyle has
described him as "That anxious, slight,
ineffectual-looking man, under thirty, in
spectacles; his eyes (were the glasses off) troubled,
careful; with upturned face, snuffing dimly the
uncertain future times; complexion of a multiplex,
atrabiliar colour, the final shade of which
may be pale sea-green."  He was small and
weakly, fond of solitude, and sober in most
things except in speech.  Fluent and rhetorical,
he soon won fame with the populace; but an
analysis of his speeches reveals them "full of
sound and fury, signifying nothing."  The latest
criticism has dubbed him "a phrase-making
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P54"></a>54}</span>
charlatan."  On July 28, 1794, still clad in
the inevitable blue coat, white waistcoat, short
yellow breeches, white stockings, and shoes
with silver buckles, he himself perished on the
guillotine that had removed so many of his
enemies.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
<i>The Listening Girl</i>.&mdash;Another of Greuze's
exceedingly pretty heads.  This picture, like the
<i>Girl's Head draped with a Scarf</i> in the National
Gallery, is an excellent representative of that
numerous class of the artist's work that consists
of the heads of girls.  The face is exceedingly
dainty, and the workmanship excellent.
The picture forms one of the Wallace Collection,
and is, therefore, easily accessible to
the public.  Although it is now called <i>The
Listening Girl</i>, it is not certain that this title
expresses the intention of the artist.

<br>
THE BROKEN PITCHER.<br>(La Cruche Cassée)
</p>

<p>
<i>The Broken Pitcher</i> (<i>La Cruche Cassée</i>).&mdash;No
picture by Greuze is more widely known
than this one.  In one of Madame Roland's
letters we are able to gain an idea of what was
thought of the work at the time that it was
painted.  She has written: "It is a girl, naïve,
rosy, charming, who has broken her pitcher.
She holds it on her arm, near to the fountain
where the accident has happened.  Her
eyes are not too wide open; her mouth is
still partly open.  She wonders what account
to give of the misfortune, and does not know
whether she is to blame or not.  It would
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P55"></a>55}</span>
not be possible to find anything more piquant
or more pretty, and the only matter upon
which one would be right to reproach Monsieur
Greuze is that he has not made the little
girl so sorry but what she would be ready
to go to the fountain again."  The derangement
of the draperies, the incongruity of the
lapful of flowers, the impossible way in which
the pitcher is being carried, are not less
characteristic of Greuze than the sweet face and the
general charm and beauty of the painting.  It
is, indeed, one of Greuze's most winsome
works, and its fascination will continue to
captivate all but the most hypercritical.  The
original is in the Louvre, but Greuze painted
the subject again with modifications, and there
are a number of sketches and studies in
existence.  For instance, in the National Gallery
of Scotland there is the preliminary sketch in
oils for this work, and many prefer this sketch
to some of Greuze's more finished pictures.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
<i>The Milkmaid</i> (<i>La Laitière</i>).&mdash;Pretty as is
this picture, it embodies a city man's
sentimentality concerning the work of a farm.
The hard labour of an actual milkmaid, and
the peculiar conditions of her employment, are
especially fatal to dainty hands, for instance.
Thus, as the presentment of a milkmaid, the
picture is far from any truth to Nature; but as
an engaging girl-picture it is one of Greuze's
most graceful and successful works.  In 1821
it was sold for 7,210 francs, but in 1899, when
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P56"></a>56}</span>
it was bequeathed to the Louvre by Baroness
de Rothschild, its value was estimated at
600,000 francs.

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
<i>Innocence</i>.&mdash;Many of the excellent qualities
of Greuze's work appear in this attractive
picture.  It is true that the lamb is
unfortunate, and, as Greuze's lambs usually are,
is more reminiscent of the Lowther Arcade
than of the meadow.  Here also we see the
head of a girl on the body of a woman;
but the general effect of the picture is one of
sweetness and tenderness, and the girl's expression
is free from the affectations which have
marred so many of the artist's paintings.  This
picture is one of the Wallace Collection.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
<i>The Pretty Laundress</i> (<i>La Belle Blanchisseuse</i>).&mdash;De
Goncourt, in a criticism of Greuze's
pictures, has written that the work that goes
on in his paintings is but a simulation of
work&mdash;that his washerwomen do not wash.
It may be that this is the picture which
inspired the criticism.  A charming girl,
elegantly dressed, sits in an impossible
position, as far as any effective washing is
concerned, before a ridiculously little bowl.  The
whole picture is most attractive, but it is not
washing day; and, perhaps, after all, washing
day is not precisely the best subject that an
artist could have selected for sublimation.  The
picture is now in the collection of Count Axel
Wachtmeister, at Wanas, in Germany.

<h3>
THE CHIEF WORKS OF GREUZE
</h3>

<p>
The largest collection of Greuze's pictures is
not in his own country, but is here in England,
at Hertford House.  The paintings forming
that collection were included in the Wallace
bequest, and thus they have become the property of
the nation.  Most other European countries have
secured examples of Greuze's work, and several
of his paintings may also be seen in America.

</p>

<p>
In this collection alone there are twenty-one examples
of the work of Greuze.  Some of these are of the best,
and a few illustrate the artist's imperfections.  For
instance, before <i>Fidelity</i> and <i>Ariadne</i> one has the same
unpleasant sensation as when a girl spoils the effect of
her beauty by stagey poses and by sentimental
attitudinizing.  <i>A Bacchante</i> is gross and voluptuous.  The most
important pictures in the collection are:

During the period of unrest that accompanied and

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
